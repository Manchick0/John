# John üë¥

> Perhaps the most modern and declarative JSON library Java has to offer.

## Path Your Way Through üë£

The John library secretly has a **DSL** built specifically for **arbitrary** JSON navigation, called [Json Paths](./src/main/java/com/manchickas/john/path/JsonPath.java).
The syntax was specifically designed to strongly resemble _file-system paths_.

A JSON Path consists of multiple segments. Each segment is separated from the preceding one with a forward slash.
The path may start with a **dot** `./`, specifying it's relative to the current node.

> [!NOTE]
> Paths are **always relative** to the node they get resolved against.
> Including a dot at the very beginning of the path is a purely **stylistic choice**, unless you're pairing it with the _subscript operator_, or using it as a _root-path_.

## Fail-fast Model üß®

As opposed to most other libraries, John takes a different approach to handling invalid JSON.
Instead of being lenient and unsafe, John uses a single, **checked exception** ‚Äî `JsonException` ‚Äî to ensure you're never left with a half-baked state.

Since in most cases JSON is parsed from an _arbitrary string_, you should **not** assume the parsing will succeed most of the time.
Quite the opposite, in fact. John thus decides to be **pessimistic** instead.

This design allows us to annotate most **JSON-related methods** and [Template](#templates) **conversions** as `@NotNull`, which resolves the unsafe chains of potential `NPE`s you get in other libraries.

It's worth noting that John keeps track of _source spans_, the source locations of **each element**, to visually enhance most error messages.

```
    "foo": "bar\w"
               ^^
(2:16-17) Encountered an unknown escape sequence '\w'.
```

## Templates üóûÔ∏è

One of the most distinctive features of the John library is **Templates**. Templates may be seen as a way to _scaffold your JSON_.

The John library uses templates **excessively**, so understanding them deeply is a **crucial step** in mastering John.
Templates are **bidirectional**. They define both how to **parse** a specific JSON element and how to **serialize** a correctly typed value back into JSON.
Any additional validation defined by the template is performed in-place for both of these steps.

> [!NOTE]
> You _almost never_ need to define your **own** templates. The standard library provides a handful of methods to compose
> them, which, when used correctly, almost completely eliminate the purpose in defining your own templates from scratch.

Templates are **stateless**. They define _how to process the value_, not the value to process. This pattern allows you to **re-use** existing templates
as much as you'd want to. Most templates should therefore be defined as `public static final` constants, rather than inlined into whatever method expects one.
